# Ready to use AWS Policies
In this repo I'm going to place the AWS policies that can save other's time.

## iam_manage_policies_policy.json
This file can help you share the policies management to other people. 
Normally development needs that to create polices for RDS, Web Server, RDS etc.

## rds_databases_access_policy.json
Using this policy file you can share full-access to the RDS service including Databases Management.
Again development teams needs such permissions to work with the databases.



Note: You can tweak as per your needs. I created these files, because these step take time when are done for the first time.
